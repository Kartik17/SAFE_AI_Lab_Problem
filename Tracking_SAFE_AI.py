Tracking for 3D cuboids

Kalman Filter 

Given:
First and Second frame annotation, which are coordinates of the cuboids

1. Prediction Step

State Vector(9x9) x = [px,py,pz,vx,vy,vz,ax,ay,az]

State Update Matrix (F) - 9x9 - (Constant Acceleration)

State Vector Covariance (P) 9x9 -  diagonal represent the variance of the state vector

Update = FPF_t + Q(noise)

2. Update Step

First, is to calculate the residual then the Kalman Gain

Measurement Vector : [px,py,pz]

(residual) y = z - Hx_new

Update the Covariance State matrix:
S = H(P_new)H_t + R

R is the noise Measurement matrix - 

Kalman Gain calculate:

K = P_new*H_t*inv(S)

Now calculate the posterior state vector and Covariance matrix

x_posterior = x_new + K*residual

P_posterior = (I - K*H)*P_new 



### Particle Filter ###

Define a state vector of each Particle

State Vector(9x9) x = [px,py,pz,vx,vy,vz,ax,ay,az]
weights of particle = w_i
Initial Belief - based on the first annotation and uncertainity


Update Step
Apply the motion update to the particles
and generate the new particles.

Apply weight to the particle , by comparing the predicted vs actual Measurements
